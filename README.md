# The Projector
[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zhcn.md)

A mod for researching Noita precisely in time. REQUIRES [Noita Dear ImGui](https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui) to work.

# Features
- Freeze the game
- Step the game by certain frames
- Slows down the game by certain times
- Enable/Disable the updates of the game respectively
- Set breakpoints for updates
- Breakpoints are simulated by disabling updates; they are not actual breakpoints but approximate them closely

# Credits
- [NoitaPatcher](https://github.com/dextercd/NoitaPatcher) provides support for implementing features related to freezing/unfreezing the game and enabling/disabling updates.
